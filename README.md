## EECS 16ML - Multilayer Perceptrons

**LEARNING OBJECTIVE**

Welcome to EECS 16ML - Multilayer Perceptrons! In this note, you'll be learning about what a Multilayer Perceptron is, how it works, and implementing your own multilayer perceptron (and working with some common packages to learn about the higher-level charactaristics of perceptrons). 

In order to tackle multilayer perceptrons, we have decided to break this course down into three parts:

1) History and rationale
2) Structure and function
3) Implementation and application

First, you will learn about the history and discovery of the multilayer perceptron as well as how the idea was originally applied and how its applications have converged. Then, you will dive into the features of a perceptron, including its anatomy and how it can be trained to perform classification and regression. Finally, you will implement your own simple preceptron and use it to perform a regression task, and you will apply existing packages to build a larger perceptron for image classification.

This course was designed for active learning, where you learn in part by building different aspects of the perceptron as you learn about them. There are seven files contained within this course:

1) README.md: this file, which outlines the contents of the course and how to navigate it
2) Note.pdf: this is the contents of the course, and where you should start. The note is divided up into sections, with each section corresponding with one of the questions in Assignment.ipynb. The note is designed for you to read a section, then complete the corresponding question in the assignment to solidify your understanding of the section. The last two sections are the longest, because they represent real world implementations of what you learned in the previous sections.
3) VisualNote.pptx: A visual version of the note, to be used when the course is taught in lecture format or if you need a visual reference for the course material. 
4) Intro to MLP.ipynb: The coding assignment, in a jupyter notebook. To be done after reading the note. 
5) Intro to MLP Solutions.ipynb: Solutions to the assignment: only to be looked at after finishing!
6) FinalQuiz.pdf: The final quiz: to be taken after finishing the assignment and the note. There are 10 questions on the quiz, and if you answer 7 or more correctly you will have passed the course!
